            <p class="blog-full" style="display: none;">
                Exploring how Forbes’ website has evolved over the years was an eye-opening experience. I’ve always looked to Forbes, particularly their 30 Under 30 list, as a source of inspiration for understanding the skills and traits of successful individuals. Seeing how their website has changed over time added another layer of appreciation for the brand. It was fascinating to see how web design has evolved over time, transforming into the seamless and intuitive experience we now expect every time we go online.
                <br><br>
                The first thing I noticed was how cluttered the old Forbes website felt. The dense text and overwhelming number of links lacked the simplicity and structure we now expect, making navigation feel cumbersome.
                <br><br>
                Another major difference was the visual design. The early 2000s version of Forbes used basic graphics and standard fonts, with no high-resolution images or multimedia elements. Compared to today’s Forbes, which features vibrant visuals and videos that immediately draw you in, the old site felt flat and unengaging. It’s incredible how much more emphasis modern web design places on aesthetics to keep users interested.
                <br><br>
                The way content was presented also stood out. Articles on the old site were long, with few subheadings or visual breaks. It made it difficult to skim or find specific information quickly. In contrast, modern Forbes articles are broken into smaller sections with clear headings, bullet points, and images. This format is so much easier to digest and feels tailored to how we consume information in the digital age.
                <br><br>
                One of the most jarring aspects of the outdated site was the lack of responsiveness. Viewing it on a smaller screen felt clunky, as it wasn’t designed to adapt to different devices. Modern Forbes, however, is fully optimized for mobile and designed with accessibility in mind, catering to the diverse needs of today’s internet users. It’s a reminder of how much web design has advanced to prioritize user experience.
                <br><br>
                Overall, visiting the older version of Forbes was like stepping back in time. It made me realize how much we’ve come to take clean layouts, intuitive navigation, and visually engaging content for granted. Being on the topic of the evolution of web development, I thought about my friend, who’s a UX Designer at NZXT. I asked him what was missing in older web development that made websites look so much sleeker today. He said it came down to things like responsive design, better navigation, and high-quality visuals. He mentioned that earlier sites focused more on functionality than ease of use, which made them feel cluttered and less engaging. His thoughts really made me see how much web design has improved to make sites more user-friendly and visually appealing.
